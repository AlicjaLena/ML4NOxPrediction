# Predicting-CO-and-NOx-Emissions-Using-Deep-Learning
This project uses sensor data from a gas turbine to predict emissions of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) using a deep learning approach. The dataset contains 11 features related to the operating conditions of the turbine, which serve as inputs to the model.
